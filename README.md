# Storybook, Figma, and React Test

![](https://i.ibb.co/LZqWLht/Screen-Shot-2021-05-22-at-2-04-14-PM.png)

This project is a simple test for Storybook integration with React.

Figma Project: https://www.figma.com/file/fe8NCZENZxnHMbQFR5Y7nt/KRFTWRK---Dev-Demo?node-id=0%3A1

## Getting Started

Download the project. In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

This will install all the necessary dependencies.

### `npm run storybook`

This will launch Storybook and you will be able to see the components.

# Disclaimer

I am aware that there are a lot of room for improvement. Given how the usability of Storybook differs from organization to organization, I have kept the code to the most basic state.
